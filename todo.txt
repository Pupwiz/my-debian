refactor dotfiles into separate repositories. see stow and myrepos:
https://github.com/gerardbm/dotfiles
https://github.com/gerardbm/vimrc
https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/
http://myrepos.branchable.com/
https://github.com/aspiers/kitenet-mr/blob/master/lib/stow

build custom file-based debian repo with packages, which I prefer to install from source

add note to readme with instructions to copy ssh and pgp keys. display readme at startup.
setup vim and rofi as described in gopass instructions
migrate from lastpass to gopass, change all passwords
backup ssh and gpg keys and passwords

refactor profiles to install on laptop into existing partition or with recreating all partitions (as it do now)

mount some partitions as read-only
ssh + protection
firewall
apparmour
backups

Customize i3 and menu
convert custom utils into scripts in $HOME/bin + $HOME/.local/share/applications/*.desktop shortcuts, which rofi can use
in case there'll be a need to replace paths in *.desktop files with user directory, `man adduser` says there is a hook to put `sed` into it 
put all the settings, packages, utils etc from backups and mac to image

Nvidia, optimus - ?, gltron, tint
sound
Yota modem
keyboard backlight, special keys
systemd timers to check mail, security updates
check that no passwords, keys are in the repo
check that user name is not hardcoded in scripts and configs

something like squid or other caching proxy. preferably, with fallback to tor/i2p (mostly for github/bitbucket/gitlub, but can be global for all web, with rules to store git data longer and discard movies)
vpn/onion/tor/i2p transport to be easily switched on, just in case?
user -> squid -> privoxy -> tor
squid for caching;
privoxy for adds filtering and routing to tor;
squid can block adds itself, here (also about ssl): https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Setting_up_Explicit_Squid_Proxy
tor as a alternative route to git (it's possible to have several cache_peer's with weights and probe them in order);
havp + clamav - for antivirus;
squid has problems with https. for git-only cache: https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/git-cache-http-server, https://github.com/sitaramc/gitpod in the docker or VM, https://github.com/Seb35/git-cache

vagrant script to automate build even more

Cannot preseed location toggle key. Even with kernel params.
