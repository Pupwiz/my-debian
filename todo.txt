refactor profiles to install on laptop into existing partition or with recreating all partitions (as it do now)

Security:
file permissions
mount some partitions as read-only (scripts to remount rw during installs/updates) - ? 
ssh + protection (fail2ban, ... ?)
firewall
apparmour
firejail - https://firejail.wordpress.com/documentation-2/
systemd timers for security updates

Backup script and approach (check, review, integrate):
backup ssh and gpg keys and passwords (+ file permissions)
backup script should run with backup group privileges, not root
use myrepos, stow and file-based private repos to backup/restore private keys and passwords
add note to readme with instructions to copy ssh and pgp keys. display readme at startup.
use --mirror to file based repositories and myrepos to backup repositories
setup mirror for all repositories to file, and some to bitbucket/gitlab
http://experiments.openhood.com/git/2010/04/09/mirror-a-git-repository-for-backup/

build custom file-based debian repo with packages, which I prefer to install from source
as I see it, this is should be a recipes in the git repo and build script, calling checkinstall for them

Passwords:
check that no passwords, keys are in the repo
check that user name is not hardcoded in scripts and configs
migrate from lastpass to gopass, change all passwords
setup vim and rofi as described in gopass instructions
change multifon script to use gopass
store newsbeuter's rss tokens in gopass

Virualization:
KVM (or VBox? KVM is Linux-only, scripts won't work on Mac)
docker
Andorid
vagrant script to automate build even more


Hardware (check/fix):
Nvidia, optimus - ?, gltron, tint
sound, input
Yota modem
keyboard backlight, special keys
hibernation, battery life
printer, scanner
camera (+ tool to switch it off)

Caching/offline mode/alternative routes for public repositories. Net security, privacy and add blocking.
something like squid or other caching proxy. preferably, with fallback to tor/i2p (mostly for github/bitbucket/gitlub, but can be global for all web, with rules to store git data longer and discard movies)
vpn/onion/tor/i2p transport to be easily switched on, just in case?
user -> squid -> privoxy -> tor
squid for caching;
privoxy for adds filtering and routing to tor;
squid can block adds itself, here (also about ssl): https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Setting_up_Explicit_Squid_Proxy
tor as a alternative route to git (it's possible to have several cache_peer's with weights and probe them in order);
havp + clamav - for antivirus;
squid has problems with https. for git-only cache: https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/git-cache-http-server, https://github.com/sitaramc/gitpod in the docker or VM, https://github.com/Seb35/git-cache


Final touch:
put all the settings, packages, utils etc from backups and mac to image + create *.desktop shortcuts for other apps
themes and plugins for vim, cmus, mutt, etc.
